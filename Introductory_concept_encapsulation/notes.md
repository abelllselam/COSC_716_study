**What is encapsulation?**

- Encapsulation means bundling a class’s data (its fields) and the methods that operate on that data into one unit, and restricting direct access to the inner state. In Java, we achieve this by:

- Marking fields private so outside code can’t touch them directly.

- Exposing public methods (getters, setters, or behaviors) that control how the data is read or modified, potentially enforcing validation or invariants.
