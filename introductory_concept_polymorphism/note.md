**Polymorphism**

- It is from the Greek for many forms. In simple terms it just means one name but many behaviors.

- A Very Simple Explanation (No code)
  Imagine you have a remote with a button labeled "Make Noise."
  When you point it at a dog, it goes "Woof!"
  When you point it at a cat, it goes "Meow!"
  When you point it at a cow, it goes "Moo!"

Here, the button (method) stays the same ("Make Noise"), but the action it causes (the actual sound) depends on the type of animal.

This is exactly polymorphism: one action, many possible outcomes based on the object.
